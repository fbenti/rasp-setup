#The install process should also install the colcon build tools, but in case that doesn't happen, you can install the tools manually:

sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions

#eigen3_cmake_module is also required, since Eigen3 is used on the transforms library:

sudo apt install ros-foxy-eigen3-cmake-module

#Some Python dependencies must also be installed (using pip or apt):

sudo pip3 install -U empy pyros-genmsg setuptools
